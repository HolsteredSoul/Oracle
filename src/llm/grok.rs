//! Grok LLM integration.
//!
//! Placeholder for xAI Grok integration. Uses the OpenAI-compatible
//! API format, so can be adapted from the OpenAI client when needed.
//!
//! Not implemented for MVP — Anthropic Claude is the primary provider
//! with OpenAI GPT-4 as fallback.

// TODO: Implement when/if Grok API access is available and needed.
// The xAI API is OpenAI-compatible, so adapting OpenAiClient with
// a different base URL (https://api.x.ai/v1/) should be straightforward.
